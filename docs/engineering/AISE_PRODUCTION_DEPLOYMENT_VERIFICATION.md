# AISE — PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT & VERIFICATION (S13)

**Authority:** Subordinate to S0 (AI Software Engineering OS).
Receives from S12 (Release Readiness / Preproduction).

**Status:** CLOSED / PASS / CANONICAL

---

## 1. PURPOSE

S13 answers:

**CAN THE EXACT S12-READY RELEASE CANDIDATE BE SAFELY DEPLOYED TO
THE VERIFIED PRODUCTION TARGET, AND DOES IT ACTUALLY OPERATE
CORRECTLY AFTER DEPLOYMENT?**

S13 consumes:

- S12 READY RELEASE CANDIDATE
- EXACT RC IDENTITY
- VERIFIED PRODUCTION TARGET
- DEPLOYMENT ORDER
- MIGRATION PLAN
- CONFIGURATION REQUIREMENTS
- PRODUCTION SMOKE CONTRACT
- RECOVERY PROCEDURE
- KNOWN RESIDUAL RISKS
- EXPLICIT OWNER PROD GO

and produces:

- PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT RESULT
- PRODUCTION VERIFICATION RESULT
- ACTUAL DEPLOYED BASELINE EVIDENCE
- S14 HANDOFF

---

## 2. S12 VS S13

Freeze:

- **S12 PROVES RELEASE READINESS.**
- **S13 EXECUTES THE AUTHORIZED PRODUCTION CHANGE.**

Therefore: **S12 READY ≠ PRODUCTION DEPLOYED.**
**PREPRODUCTION PASS ≠ PRODUCTION PASS.**

S13 must verify actual production result after deployment.

---

## 3. S13 VS S14

Freeze:

- **S13 DEPLOYS AND VERIFIES PRODUCTION.**
- **S14 CLOSES THE OPERATIONAL BASELINE AND HANDOVER.**

Therefore: **PRODUCTION VERIFIED ≠ PROJECT BASELINE CLOSED.**

S13 must not perform full S14 operational closure.

---

## 4. OWNER PROD GO IS A HARD GATE

No actual production write may occur without explicit production
authorization.

Required: **OWNER PROD GO** or a clearly equivalent statement that
explicitly authorizes production deployment of the identified Release
Candidate to the identified production target.

Statements that are NOT sufficient by themselves: GO S13, continue,
go, merge, ship it, looks good, CI passed, S12 passed, proceed
autonomously, finish the project.

The governance-authoring command `GO S13` authorizes creation of the
universal S13 protocol only. It does NOT authorize real production
deployment.

---

## 5. PROD GO MUST BE BOUND TO A RELEASE

Production authorization must identify, directly or through an
unambiguous current S12 artifact: RELEASE CANDIDATE, PRODUCTION
TARGET, AUTHORIZED PRODUCTION OPERATION.

Where multiple candidate releases or targets exist: do not infer. Ask
for clarification. Do not treat an old PROD GO as authorization for
a newer Release Candidate.

---

## 6. ENTRY PRECONDITIONS

Normal actual S13 entry requires:

- S12 VERDICT: READY or READY WITH NON-BLOCKING FINDINGS
- EXACT RELEASE CANDIDATE: IDENTIFIED
- RC DRIFT: 0 unresolved
- PRODUCTION TARGET: IDENTIFIED
- DEPLOYMENT PROCEDURE: DEFINED
- MIGRATION SEQUENCE: DEFINED / N/A
- CONFIGURATION REQUIREMENTS: DEFINED
- PRODUCTION SMOKE CHECKS: DEFINED
- RECOVERY APPROACH: DEFINED
- BLOCKING S12 FINDINGS: 0
- EXPLICIT OWNER PROD GO: YES

If any required condition fails: **S13 PRECONDITION NOT MET.**
**NO PRODUCTION WRITE.**

---

## 7. EXACT DEPLOYMENT SUBJECT

Before deployment record: release ID, RC commit SHA,
artifact/build identity where applicable, container/image digest
where applicable, migration set, deployment source, production
target, authorization reference.

Do NOT deploy: latest main, latest artifact, latest successful
build — unless that exact object is also the verified S12 Release
Candidate.

---

## 8. FINAL RC DRIFT CHECK

Immediately before production write: compare intended production
candidate with S12-approved candidate.

Detect material drift in: commit, artifact, dependency lockfile,
migration set, configuration contract, build source.

If material difference exists: **RC DRIFT DETECTED. STOP.** Return
to affected S10 → S11 → S12 as appropriate.

Do NOT deploy an unverified variation.

---

## 9. PRODUCTION TARGET VERIFICATION

Immediately before production write verify the actual target. Where
applicable confirm: provider, organization/account, project/service,
production environment, production database, production domain,
branch/artifact source, region, intended deployment purpose.

Preserve: **TARGET NOT VERIFIED → NO WRITE.**

Authentication success alone is insufficient.

---

## 10. EXTERNAL PARAMETER GATE

Apply canonical External Parameter Gate (S0 §25).

Do NOT request production credentials preemptively. When actual S13
execution reaches a required production capability: first inspect
whether an authorized authenticated mechanism already exists.

If absent: **EXTERNAL PARAMETER BLOCKER.** Return the canonical
structured report with: SYSTEM, BLOCKED OPERATION, PARAMETER /
CAPABILITY, CATEGORY, PURPOSE, SECRET YES/NO, EXPECTED LOCATION,
REQUIRED SCOPE, TARGET, WHY REQUIRED NOW, CURRENT COMPLETED STATE,
RESUME POINT, OWNER ACTION.

Do NOT ask OWNER to paste secrets into chat by default. After
configuration: verify capability, verify target, recheck RC if
necessary, resume exact operation.

---

## 11. MINIMUM PRODUCTION PRIVILEGE

Request/use only the privilege necessary for the authorized
production operation.

Examples: deployment capability, migration capability, configuration
read/write if explicitly needed, production log read.

Do NOT automatically request: organization owner, global admin,
database superuser, full cloud administration — when narrower
production capability suffices.

Fantomas/Ghost exceptions remain governed by approved project
architecture.

---

## 12. PRE-DEPLOYMENT CHECKPOINT

Immediately before irreversible or externally visible action confirm:
RC exact, production target exact, OWNER PROD GO valid, required
credential/capability available, migration sequence known,
configuration prerequisites satisfied, recovery approach known,
production smoke contract available, blocking condition count = 0.

This should be a compact operational checkpoint. Do not create
bureaucracy.

---

## 13. DEPLOYMENT ORDER IS AUTHORITATIVE

Use the S12-approved deployment order.

Possible examples: config → migration → application, migration →
application, application → migration, external service setup →
application, single platform release, rolling/canary sequence.

Do NOT invent a different production order during S13 unless evidence
requires stopping and revising S12.

---

## 14. USE EXISTING DEPLOYMENT MECHANISM

Prefer the canonical project deployment mechanism.

Examples: platform deployment, CI/CD release action, existing
deployment CLI, container orchestrator, existing release script.

Do NOT create a new deployment mechanism merely for S13. Do NOT
bypass the project's canonical path for convenience.

---

## 15. NO HIDDEN MANUAL PRODUCTION CHANGES

Do NOT silently: edit production files manually, apply ad-hoc SQL,
change production config outside canonical mechanism, modify
infrastructure manually, patch a running service — unless the
project's approved operational model explicitly requires that
mechanism and it is authorized.

Production state must remain explainable after the session ends.

---

## 16. CONFIGURATION WRITE CONTROL

Production configuration changes are allowed in S13 only when: they
are part of the exact S12 release procedure, their target is
verified, OWNER PROD GO covers the production operation, required
value/source is known, change can be evidenced.

Do NOT invent missing config values. Do NOT expose secret values in
logs/reports.

---

## 17. DATABASE MIGRATION AUTHORIZATION

A production migration may run only when: migration belongs to exact
Release Candidate, S12 migration readiness passed, production target
DB verified, migration order known, OWNER PROD GO covers release
deployment, canonical migration mechanism is used.

No ad-hoc schema mutation.

---

## 18. DATABASE BACKUP / RECOVERY PRECHECK

Where migration/data risk materially requires recovery capability:
verify the S12 recovery precondition before migration.

Do NOT claim "backup exists" or "rollback is possible" without
factual evidence.

If required recovery capability cannot be verified: **STOP before
risky migration.**

---

## 19. MIGRATION EXECUTION

When authorized: execute canonical production migration. Capture
sufficient evidence: migration identifier, target identity,
start/result, success/failure, material warning.

Do NOT log secret connection strings. Do not retry a failed
migration blindly.

Failure: **CAUSE = UNKNOWN → INVESTIGATE.**

---

## 20. PARTIAL MIGRATION FAILURE

If migration partially executes: do NOT automatically rerun.
Determine factual state. Classify: fully failed before change,
partially applied, fully applied but command reported error, unknown.

Use canonical migration tooling/state. Do not guess. A partially
migrated production DB is a material incident condition.

---

## 21. APPLICATION DEPLOYMENT

Deploy the exact S12 Release Candidate using canonical mechanism.

Verify deployment system reports the expected: commit, artifact,
image, version, source.

Do not accept "deployment succeeded" if the deployed identity cannot
be reconciled with the intended RC.

---

## 22. DEPLOYMENT SUCCESS ≠ PRODUCTION SUCCESS

Freeze: **PLATFORM DEPLOYMENT SUCCESS ≠ APPLICATION VERIFIED.**

After deployment: run production verification. Do not stop because
Vercel/cloud/provider reports success.

---

## 23. PRODUCTION SMOKE TESTS

Execute the compact S12-defined smoke contract.

Examples where applicable: service reachable, expected production
domain responds, application boots, authentication available,
critical route loads, database connectivity works, critical read
works, key integration reachable.

Use only checks appropriate to the application.

---

## 24. SAFE PRODUCTION VERIFICATION

Production verification should minimize production side effects.

Prefer: read-only observation, existing health path, safe
authenticated read, known production workflow observation, existing
system evidence.

A production write test may be performed only when: explicitly part
of approved verification contract, safe, reversible or
non-destructive, target and data subject known.

Do NOT create junk production records merely to claim PASS.

---

## 25. CRITICAL FUNCTIONAL VERIFICATION

Where appropriate verify release-critical behavior after production
deployment.

Examples: authentication, primary workflow, critical calculation,
critical authorization path, critical persistence path, critical
external integration.

Verify only what materially proves release health. Do not rerun the
entire test suite manually in production.

---

## 26. AUTHORIZATION VERIFICATION IN PROD

Where release affects authorization: verify critical production
authorization semantics using safe methods.

At minimum where relevant: allowed principal succeeds, forbidden
principal remains forbidden, server-side enforcement intact,
privileged boundary unchanged.

Do not use destructive admin actions merely for testing.

---

## 27. FANTOMAS / GHOST PRODUCTION SEMANTICS

Where applicable preserve exactly: Fantomas inherits 100%
SUPER_ADMIN capabilities plus Fantomas-only: break-glass, bootstrap,
recovery, exceptional administration.

Keep: hasSuperAdminCapabilities(principal) distinct from:
isFantomas(principal).

Do not "simplify" privilege semantics during production deployment.

---

## 28. OBSERVABILITY DURING DEPLOYMENT

Use existing project/platform evidence to observe: deployment result,
runtime errors, startup failure, migration result, critical
application errors, health state.

Do NOT automatically build new dashboards/monitoring systems.

---

## 29. OBSERVATION WINDOW

Use an observation duration proportionate to the release and project.

Do NOT invent arbitrary multi-hour waiting periods. If immediate
deterministic evidence is sufficient: verify and proceed. If the
release has known delayed behavior: observe only as required by
contract.

Do NOT create background monitoring automatically.

---

## 30. NO BACKGROUND WAITING

S13 must not say "I will monitor this for the next few hours" unless
an explicitly authorized automation/task exists.

If later observation is required: either perform available
synchronous verification, or STOP with exact required follow-up, or
OWNER explicitly authorizes a scheduled/conditional task separately.

**ZERO SCHEDULED WORK remains default.**

---

## 31. PRODUCTION VERIFICATION EVIDENCE

Capture enough evidence to prove: what was deployed, where,
when/context, deployment result, migration result, smoke result,
critical functional result, known anomalies.

Do not copy: secrets, sensitive student/customer data, full
production payloads into governance reports.

---

## 32. PRODUCTION VERDICTS

Define:

- **DEPLOYED / VERIFIED** — Exact RC deployed successfully and
  required production verification passes.
- **DEPLOYED / VERIFIED WITH NON-BLOCKING FINDINGS** — Production
  verification passes. Only Moderate/Low non-blocking findings
  remain.
- **DEPLOYMENT FAILED / RECOVERED** — Deployment failed or
  verification failed, but approved recovery restored known-good
  service/state.
- **DEPLOYMENT FAILED / UNRECOVERED** — Production is not in
  verified intended or recovered state.
- **BLOCKED BEFORE DEPLOYMENT** — Production write did not begin
  because required authorization, parameter, target verification, or
  prerequisite was unavailable.
- **BLOCKED DURING VERIFICATION** — Deployment occurred, but
  required production verification cannot be completed.

Do NOT use ambiguous: "MOSTLY DEPLOYED."

---

## 33. FAILURE = CAUSE UNKNOWN

Any unexpected production failure starts as: **CAUSE = UNKNOWN.**

Examples: deployment failure, migration error, 500 response, auth
failure, provider timeout, data mismatch.

Initial failure is not enough to declare root cause. Investigate
enough to classify safely.

---

## 34. FAILURE CLASSIFICATION

Classify as applicable: IMPLEMENTATION DEFECT, MIGRATION DEFECT,
CONFIGURATION DEFECT, PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT / INFRA DEFECT,
EXTERNAL DEPENDENCY DEFECT, EXTERNAL PARAMETER BLOCKER, DEPLOYMENT
TOOLING DEFECT, DATA DEFECT, AUTHORIZATION DEFECT, SPECIFICATION
AMBIGUITY, UNKNOWN.

UNKNOWN → INVESTIGATE. **NEVER UNKNOWN → RANDOM PROD CHANGE.**

---

## 35. STOP-THE-LINE CONDITIONS

Stop further rollout/change when a material condition appears, such
as: critical startup failure, critical route unavailable, migration
failure, data integrity risk, authorization breach, wrong production
target, wrong RC deployed, critical integration failure, unknown
state after partial deployment.

Do not continue merely because deployment procedure has remaining
steps.

---

## 36. RECOVERY DECISION

If material deployment/verification failure occurs: use S12-defined
recovery strategy. Choose based on factual state.

Possible: platform rollback, application rollback, config revert,
migration recovery, forward-fix, traffic reversal, feature
disablement if approved, R3 Recovery escalation.

Do NOT automatically assume rollback is safest.

---

## 37. ROLLBACK SAFETY

Before rollback evaluate: application/database compatibility,
whether migration was applied, whether new production data exists,
whether previous app can read current schema, whether rollback
destroys/corrupts data.

If rollback is unsafe: do NOT execute it simply because it is
available. Use approved recovery path.

---

## 38. RECOVERY IS A CONTROLLED ACTION

Production recovery actions are bounded by: the existing S12
recovery plan, current factual failure state, OWNER authorization
where required by project governance.

Do not use incident pressure to justify uncontrolled changes.

---

## 39. EMERGENCY BREAK-GLASS

If a true production emergency requires break-glass action: route
through approved recovery/break-glass governance.

Do NOT use Fantomas/Ghost merely because normal deployment is
inconvenient. Fantomas is exceptional authority, not routine
deployment shortcut. All material exceptional actions should remain
auditable.

---

## 40. FAILED DEPLOYMENT DOES NOT AUTHORIZE HOTFIX

Freeze: **S13 FAILURE ≠ AUTOMATIC AUTHORIZATION TO WRITE NEW CODE.**

If implementation correction is needed: route R2 HOTFIX or S10
correction as appropriate. Then obtain required
verification/readiness before redeployment.

Do NOT code directly inside S13 to make production green.

---

## 41. PRODUCTION CODE PATCHING PROHIBITED

S13 must not edit product source code as part of deployment
verification.

If a source defect is discovered: capture evidence, classify,
restore/recover service if necessary, route corrective
implementation separately.

---

## 42. CONFIGURATION-ONLY RECOVERY

A configuration correction may occur during S13 only when:
configuration defect is proven, correct value/source is
authoritative, production target verified, change is inside
authorized release/recovery scope, result is verified.

Do NOT use config manipulation to hide code defects.

---

## 43. DEPLOYED WRONG RELEASE

If production receives an artifact different from intended RC:
classify: **WRONG RELEASE BASELINE.** This is a blocking production
defect. Do not mark S13 PASS even if application appears healthy.
Restore/deploy correct approved baseline according to safe recovery.

---

## 44. DEPLOYED STATE MUST BE IDENTIFIABLE

At S13 completion know, where applicable: production release ID,
commit, artifact, container digest, migration state, configuration
baseline reference, deployment timestamp/context.

Do not leave production described only as "latest."

---

## 45. PRODUCTION DATA OBSERVATION

When verification needs DB observation: query only what is
necessary. Prefer: aggregate/state checks, known safe records,
non-sensitive evidence.

Do not expose sensitive data in final reports. Do not alter
production data unless explicitly authorized.

---

## 46. EXTERNAL INTEGRATION PRODUCTION CHECK

Where integration is release-critical: verify minimum material
production behavior.

Examples: connection established, callback endpoint valid, request
accepted, expected non-destructive response.

Avoid triggering: real payments, mass email, bulk notifications,
destructive external side effects — unless explicitly part of
authorized production acceptance.

---

## 47. THIRD-PARTY FAILURE

If production is correct but external provider is unavailable:
classify: EXTERNAL DEPENDENCY DEFECT. Determine whether release
remains acceptable according to approved failure semantics. Do not
falsely classify product implementation defective.

---

## 48. KNOWN NON-BLOCKING FINDINGS

Moderate/Low production observations may be recorded without
automatic rollback if: contracted critical behavior passes, no
material user/data/security impact exists, release remains
operationally sound.

Do not create automatic hotfix workstream.

---

## 49. CRITICAL / MATERIAL HIGH FINDINGS

Critical/material High issues normally block successful S13
completion.

Examples: data corruption, authorization bypass, critical workflow
failure, wrong production target, unsafe migration state, major
availability failure.

Do not downgrade merely to finish deployment.

---

## 50. PRODUCTION EVIDENCE FRESHNESS

Production verification applies to the exact deployed baseline.
If another deployment/change occurs after verification: determine
whether S13 evidence remains valid. Do not claim old production
verification proves a newer release.

---

## 51. MULTI-INSTANCE / ROLLING DEPLOYMENTS

Where project already uses: rolling, blue/green, canary,
multi-region, multi-instance deployment — S13 should verify actual
intended rollout state.

Do NOT impose these strategies on projects that do not use them.
Simple projects remain simple.

---

## 52. PARTIAL ROLLOUT

If only part of the intended production fleet receives new RC: do
not claim complete deployment unless the approved strategy defines
that partial state as the intended checkpoint. Record exact rollout
state.

---

## 53. RELEASE TAG / VERSION

If project uses release tags/version identifiers: verify they
correspond to exact deployed RC. Do not create versioning
bureaucracy when project does not need it.

---

## 54. PRODUCTION SMOKE FAILURE

If a required smoke check fails: S13 cannot report DEPLOYED /
VERIFIED. Classify cause. Determine: recover, rollback, forward-fix
route, or blocked verification — according to evidence.

---

## 55. HEALTHY PLATFORM / BROKEN BUSINESS LOGIC

Provider says DEPLOYMENT SUCCESS. HTTP health returns 200. But
critical contracted business behavior fails.

Expected: **S13 FAIL. Infrastructure health ≠ business
correctness.**

---

## 56. SAFE WRITE VERIFICATION

If production acceptance contract genuinely requires a write:
define beforehand: actor, scope, data, expected result,
cleanup/retention behavior, risk.

Do not improvise write verification after deployment.

---

## 57. AUDITABILITY

Production deployment should leave enough trace to answer: who/what
authorized it, what RC was deployed, where, what migrations/config
changes occurred, what verification passed, whether recovery
occurred.

Avoid unnecessary logging of sensitive data.

---

## 58. S13 PRODUCTION REPORT

For actual project execution, default durable artifact:

```
docs/release/RC-<ID>_PRODUCTION_VERIFICATION.md
```

Recommended structure:

```
# PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT & VERIFICATION — RC-XXX

## 1. Deployment Status
   Release ID, S12 readiness, OWNER PROD GO, production target,
   deployed RC

## 2. Pre-Deployment Checkpoint
## 3. Deployment Sequence
## 4. Migration Result
## 5. Configuration Changes
## 6. Deployment Result
## 7. Smoke Verification
## 8. Critical Functional Verification
## 9. External Integration Verification
## 10. Observed Production State
## 11. Findings
## 12. Recovery / Rollback Actions
## 13. Final Production Verdict
## 14. S14 Handoff
```

Do not store secrets.

---

## 59. PROJECT_STATE DURING S13

For actual project S13 update factual state where project governance
requires it.

Possible transitional state: RELEASE DEPLOYING, then: PRODUCTION
DEPLOYED / VERIFIED, or failure/recovery state.

Do NOT yet perform full baseline closure owned by S14.

---

## 60. S13 SUCCESS STATE

Successful actual S13 requires:

- OWNER PROD GO: VALID
- EXACT RC: DEPLOYED
- PRODUCTION TARGET: VERIFIED
- DEPLOYMENT RESULT: PASS
- MIGRATION RESULT: PASS / N/A
- CONFIGURATION RESULT: PASS / N/A
- PRODUCTION SMOKE: PASS
- CRITICAL FUNCTIONAL VERIFICATION: PASS
- CRITICAL INTEGRATIONS: PASS / justified N/A
- CRITICAL FINDINGS: 0
- MATERIAL HIGH BLOCKERS: 0
- DEPLOYED BASELINE: IDENTIFIED
- RECOVERY: NOT REQUIRED or completed and separately classified

Then: **S13 DEPLOYED / VERIFIED. NEXT: S14 — OPERATIONAL HANDOVER /
BASELINE CLOSURE.**

---

## 61. SUCCESS AFTER RECOVERY

If attempted release fails and production is restored to PREVIOUS
known-good baseline: do NOT report the new RC as DEPLOYED / VERIFIED.

Correct status: **DEPLOYMENT FAILED / RECOVERED.** Production service
may be healthy again, but the attempted release was not successfully
deployed. S14 must receive the actual production baseline.

---

## 62. FAILURE WITHOUT RECOVERY

If production remains in: unknown, broken, partially migrated,
partially deployed, unsafe state:

**S13 DEPLOYMENT FAILED / UNRECOVERED.** This is a material
operational incident. Route R3 Recovery or other applicable
emergency path.

Do NOT proceed to normal S14 closure as if release succeeded.

---

## 63. BLOCKED BEFORE PROD

If blocker occurs before first production write: status:
**BLOCKED BEFORE DEPLOYMENT.**

Examples: OWNER PROD GO absent, target not verified, credential
unavailable, RC drift, required recovery prerequisite missing.

Preserve completed preparation. Record exact resume point. No
production state changed.

---

## 64. BLOCKED AFTER DEPLOYMENT

If deployment succeeded but verification cannot complete: status:
**BLOCKED DURING VERIFICATION.**

Do NOT automatically rollback solely because evidence collection is
blocked unless release safety requires it.

Record: actual deployed state, known health evidence, missing
verification, risk, required next action.

---

## 65. S14 HANDOFF

On successful production deployment hand off: release ID, exact
deployed commit/artifact, production target, deployment result,
migration state, configuration change references, smoke results,
critical functional results, integration results, known
non-blocking findings, residual risks, production verdict, recovery
actions if any, actual factual production baseline — to:

**S14 — OPERATIONAL HANDOVER / BASELINE CLOSURE** → docs/engineering/AISE_OPERATIONAL_HANDOVER_BASELINE_CLOSURE.md

---

## 66. S14 IS NOT AUTOMATIC

Even after S13 success: do NOT automatically implement S14 protocol
or unrelated next work.

For actual project lifecycle, S14 may follow according to authorized
delivery governance. For this universal AISE construction task:
STOP after S13 canonicalization.

---

## 67. ZERO SCHEDULED WORK

S13 must not create: cron, scheduled deployments, scheduled
migrations, background AI monitoring, automatic rollback watcher,
recurring production checks, nightly smoke tests, automatic
promotion — unless OWNER explicitly authorizes the exact automation.

---

## 68. NO AUTO-ROLLBACK POLICY INVENTION

Do not create automatic rollback systems merely because S13
discusses recovery. Use existing platform/project behavior.
Automation requires explicit authorization.

---

## 69. VALIDATION SCENARIOS

Validate S13 deterministically.

**S13-01 — S12 READY / NO PROD GO**
S12 READY. Exact RC known. OWNER PROD GO absent.
→ BLOCKED BEFORE DEPLOYMENT. NO PROD WRITE. **PASS**

**S13-02 — GOVERNANCE GO CONFUSION**
OWNER says GO S13 while constructing AISE S13 protocol.
→ authorizes governance protocol creation only. Does NOT authorize
application production deployment. **PASS**

**S13-03 — EXPLICIT PROD GO**
OWNER explicitly authorizes production deployment of exact RC to
exact production target.
→ production gate satisfied, subject to remaining prerequisites.
**PASS**

**S13-04 — RC DRIFT**
S12 READY for commit A. Production source points to commit B.
→ STOP. RC DRIFT. NO DEPLOY. **PASS**

**S13B-05 — TARGET UNKNOWN**
Production credential valid. Actual project/environment identity not
verified.
→ TARGET NOT VERIFIED → NO WRITE. **PASS**

**S13-06 — CREDENTIAL MISSING**
Deployment reaches required production authentication boundary.
→ EXTERNAL PARAMETER BLOCKER. Preserve state. Record resume point.
**PASS**

**S13-07 — EXCESS PRIVILEGE**
Deployment requires project deploy access. Agent proposes requesting
global cloud owner.
→ reject excessive privilege. Use minimum required capability.
**PASS**

**S13-08 — CANONICAL DEPLOYMENT PATH**
Project already has canonical deployment mechanism. Agent proposes
manual alternate deployment.
→ reject unless justified/authorized. **PASS**

**S13-09 — MIGRATION TARGET WRONG**
Migration command connects to non-production DB while deployment
target is production.
→ STOP. Do not run migration. **PASS**

**S13-10 — MIGRATION FAILS**
Production migration reports error.
→ CAUSE UNKNOWN. Inspect factual migration state. Do not blindly
retry. **PASS**

**S13-11 — PARTIAL MIGRATION**
Some migration effects applied before failure.
→ material incident. Determine exact state. Use recovery plan. No
blind rerun. **PASS**

**S13-12 — PROVIDER DEPLOY SUCCESS**
Platform reports deployment success. Critical application route
fails.
→ S13 FAIL. Deployment success ≠ production verification. **PASS**

**S13-13 — HEALTH 200 / BUSINESS WRONG**
Health endpoint is OK. Critical calculation returns wrong business
result.
→ FAIL. **PASS**

**S13-14 — SAFE PRODUCTION CHECK**
Release requires only read verification.
→ do not create write test data unnecessarily. **PASS**

**S13-15 — AUTHORIZATION REGRESSION**
UI hides admin action. Direct server request is now unauthorizedly
accepted.
→ material FAIL. **PASS**

**S13-16 — EXTERNAL PROVIDER DOWN**
Application deployment correct. Required third-party provider
unavailable.
→ classify external dependency defect. Apply approved failure
semantics. Do not automatically blame implementation. **PASS**

**S13-17 — UNSAFE ROLLBACK**
New DB migration is not backward compatible with old app. Agent
proposes platform rollback to old app.
→ do not rollback blindly. Use safe recovery plan. **PASS**

**S13-18 — DEPLOYMENT FAILS / RECOVERED**
New RC fails. Previous known-good production baseline restored and
verified.
→ DEPLOYMENT FAILED / RECOVERED. Do NOT report new RC as deployed.
**PASS**

**S13-19 — DEPLOYMENT FAILS / UNRECOVERED**
Production remains broken/unknown after failure.
→ DEPLOYMENT FAILED / UNRECOVERED. Route recovery. Do not proceed
as normal success. **PASS**

**S13-20 — WRONG ARTIFACT**
Production deployed artifact differs from intended RC.
→ blocking failure. No PASS even if app appears healthy. **PASS**

**S13-21 — NON-BLOCKING FINDING**
Deployment and all critical verification pass. One Low cosmetic
issue observed.
→ DEPLOYED / VERIFIED WITH NON-BLOCKING FINDINGS may be valid. Do
not auto-hotfix. **PASS**

**S13-22 — CRITICAL DEFECT FOUND**
Critical production defect discovered.
→ stop rollout. classify. recover if required. No source-code patch
inside S13. **PASS**

**S13-23 — SCHEDULED MONITORING**
Agent proposes monitoring production hourly after deploy.
→ PROHIBITED absent explicit automation authorization. **PASS**

**S13-24 — SUCCESS**
Exact RC deployed to verified production target under explicit OWNER
PROD GO. Migration/config pass. Smoke passes. Critical functions
pass. No blockers.
→ DEPLOYED / VERIFIED. S14 next recommended. STOP. **PASS**

---

## 70. ANTI-UNCONTROLLED-PRODUCTION GATE

Verify S13 does NOT:

- treat GO S13 as production authorization
- deploy without explicit OWNER PROD GO
- deploy ambiguous latest code
- ignore RC drift
- write to unverified target
- request credentials prematurely
- request unnecessary admin privilege
- bypass canonical deployment mechanism
- run ad-hoc production SQL
- blindly retry migration
- declare success from platform deploy status only
- declare success from health endpoint only
- create unsafe production test data
- hide authorization regression
- blindly rollback incompatible schema/app
- write new product code during S13
- auto-hotfix
- auto-promote another release
- create scheduled monitoring
- create cron
- start S14 automatically

**PASS**

---

## 71. PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT QUALITY GATE

Before actual S13 may report DEPLOYED / VERIFIED:

| Gate | Required State |
|------|---------------|
| S12 READY | YES |
| OWNER PROD GO | EXPLICIT / VALID |
| EXACT RC | VERIFIED |
| RC DRIFT | 0 |
| PRODUCTION TARGET | VERIFIED |
| REQUIRED EXTERNAL CAPABILITY | AVAILABLE |
| MINIMUM PRIVILEGE | USED |
| DEPLOYMENT ORDER | FOLLOWED |
| CANONICAL DEPLOYMENT MECHANISM | USED |
| MIGRATION | PASS / N/A |
| CONFIGURATION | PASS / N/A |
| DEPLOYMENT | PASS |
| PRODUCTION SMOKE | PASS |
| CRITICAL FUNCTIONAL VERIFY | PASS |
| AUTHORIZATION VERIFY | PASS / N/A |
| CRITICAL INTEGRATIONS | PASS / justified N/A |
| CRITICAL FINDINGS | 0 |
| MATERIAL HIGH BLOCKERS | 0 |
| WRONG RELEASE BASELINE | NO |
| UNKNOWN PARTIAL DEPLOYMENT STATE | NO |
| UNAUTHORIZED PROD ACTION | 0 |
| UNAUTHORIZED AUTOMATION | 0 |
| DEPLOYED BASELINE | IDENTIFIED |
| S14 | NOT STARTED |

---

## 72. SIZE AND CLARITY PRINCIPLE

Comprehensive but operational. Clarity wins over arbitrary word
count. Target approximately 3200–4800 words. Avoid: generic
incident-management manual, generic SRE encyclopedia,
deployment-vendor-specific instructions, mandatory canary/blue-green,
mandatory staging architecture, huge production checklist, automatic
monitoring architecture, process theatre.

---

## 73. COMPATIBILITY

S13 is:

- project-agnostic
- technology-neutral at protocol level
- usable by AI agents and human release operators
- usable without chat memory
- production-safe
- evidence-driven
- compatible with simple and complex deployment platforms
- independently reproducible where practical

---

## 74. RESPONSIBILITY BOUNDARY

- S9 owns work package authorization and contracting.
- S10 owns implementation execution.
- S11 owns verification and acceptance.
- S12 owns release readiness.
- S13 owns production deployment and verification.
- S14 owns operational handover / baseline closure.
